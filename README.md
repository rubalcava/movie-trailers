#Movie Trailers Website

* This project uses object oriented programming techniques to create a movie trailer website using Udacity's starter code (fresh_tomatoes.py), and my own code.

* How to run:
    * Download/clone this project
    * Navigate to the project folder (wherever you cloned/downloaded it) with either a terminal or GUI.
    * You can run it one of two ways:
        * (If you have Python installed) Using a terminal editor from the project folder location, run: python entertainment_center.py
        * (Doesn't need Python installed) Use a web browser to open (Usually File>Open) fresh_tomatoes.html which will be located in the project folder
